# Modeling Network Load and Player Experience in Online Games: A Monte Carlo and Multiprocessed Approach

## Introduction
Modern online games often experience unpredictable and spiky loads:

- New updates cause traffic surges.
- Events or tournaments attract mass logins.
- Weekend vs weekday behavior differs.


Backend engineers need to predict when and how a server might break down under pressure. But they rarely have access to complete real-world data before launch ‚Äî this is where simulations help.

By using Monte Carlo simulations, we can artificially model thousands of "what if" days ‚Äî each with unique conditions like peak hours, sudden traffic, or player dropouts. This gives developers insight into system limits and risk patterns ‚Äî before the servers go live.

## Problem
Questions: 
- How do key factors such as latency spike and server overload influence the probability of player disconnection or dissatisfaction?


- What thresholds of player load or connection instability lead to a measurable degradation in server performance metrics like matchmaking time or session uptime?


- How do varying levels of player concurrency, latency, and dropout rates affect overall system reliability and player satisfaction in simulated multiplayer environments?


## Objectives
Simulate an online game server's performance under increasing player load.
- *Goal*: Identify the threshold where latency and failure rates begin to spike (i.e., the ‚Äúoverload point‚Äù).

## Methodology
### Initialize the Monte Carlo Data Simulation
- **Players as Agents**: Each player is an agent with traits (ping, patience, quit rate, etc.).
- **Servers**: Have capacity, load limits, latency response, crash thresholds.
- **Environment**: Simulate match queue, game sessions, and real-time behavior.
- **Simulated Days**: Each day will be broken into minutes thus having 1440 minutes each simulation day where each player joins randomly within the random probability set.

## Metrics to Collect
Average latency per session
Percentage of unhappy players
Server overload rate
Average matchmaking time
Simulation runtime (seq vs parallel)

## Simulation Execution - Sequential and Multi-threading side-by-side
score = 100 \
    - (avg_latency * 0.3) \
    - (disconnect_rate * 50) \
    - (unhappy_player_rate * 40) \
    - (overloaded_server_rate * 30)


## ‚úÖ Why Compare Sequential vs Multithreading/Multiprocessing?
Simulating thousands of randomized game server days ‚Äî that's a perfect fit for:
Monte Carlo (random scenarios)
Embarrassingly parallel workloads (each day is independent)


Comparing sequential vs. parallel execution gives:
Performance benchmarks (how much faster is parallelism?)
Insight into Python's threading/multiprocessing behavior
Relevance to real backend workloads


## Challenges in Finding Specific Published Research

While the application is logical and feasible, specific detailed research papers on using Monte Carlo for game server capacity planning with these precise goals might be less common in public academic databases compared to other applications of Monte Carlo simulation (like in finance or physics). This could be because:

- *Proprietary Information*: Game companies often consider their backend infrastructure and load testing methodologies to be competitive secrets. Detailed simulation models and results are unlikely to be published publicly.
- *Focus on Applied Engineering*: Much of the work in game backend development is focused on practical implementation and engineering challenges rather than theoretical research published in academic journals.
- *Variability Across Games*: Game backends are highly game-specific. A detailed simulation model for one game might not be directly applicable to another, making generalized research more challenging.
- *Alternative Simulation Techniques*: While Monte Carlo is suitable, other simulation techniques (e.g., discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling) or purely data-driven approaches (using machine learning on live telemetry data) might also be used in the industry.

## Significance of the Study:
Helps developers anticipate server behavior under real-world chaotic player behavior.
Offers insights on how parallel computing can boost simulation-based testing.

- *(optional)* Provides back-end engineers with a flexible model to optimize matchmaking, queuing, and autoscaling algorithms.
Stress test without players (controlled), stress test with player (uncontrolled & unpredictable)
