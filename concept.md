# Monte Carlo Simulation of Server Load and Player Behavior in Large Scale Multiplayer Games

<h2 align=left>Abstract (Template)</h2>
This study explores the performance limitations of centralized multiplayer game servers using a Monte Carlo simulation of diverse player behaviors. We model three player archetypes (idler, casual, pro) and tract metrics such as latency, happiness, and disconnections over time. Through repeated simulations across varying server capacities, we estimate the overload thresholds and average player satisfaction. The results indicate that player diversity significantly impacts server load, and that a server size of [SERVER_SIZE] minimizes overloads in 90% of scenarios. This work can inform better capacity planning for MMORPG and open-world multiplayer games.

<h2 align=center>I. Introduction</h2>
Modern online games often experience unpredictable and spiky loads:

- New updates cause traffic surges.
- Events or tournaments attract mass logins.
- Weekend vs weekday behavior differs.


```
Backend engineers need to predict when and how a server might break down under pressure. But they rarely have access to complete real-world data before launch ‚Äî this is where simulations help.

By using Monte Carlo simulations, we can artificially model thousands of "what if" days ‚Äî each with unique conditions like peak hours, sudden traffic, or player dropouts. This gives developers insight into system limits and risk patterns ‚Äî before the servers go live.
```

The objectives of this study is to simulate an online game server's performance under increasing player load and to estimate the optimal server capacity and predict overload thresholds in open-world multiplayer games using player behavior models and Monte Carlo simulation.

## Research Questions
1. What is the relationship between server capacity and the rate of player disconnections due to overload?

2. What is the tipping point of server capacity that leads to a significant rise in unhappy players?

3. How do different types of players (idler, casual, pro) impact server load and average session duration?


4. What server capacity minimizes overload probability in 90% of the simulation runs?

### Initialize the Monte Carlo Data Simulation
- **Players as Agents**: Each player is an agent with traits (ping, patience, quit rate, etc.).
- **Servers**: Have capacity, load limits, latency response, crash thresholds.
- **Environment**: Simulate match queue, game sessions, and real-time behavior.
- **Simulated Days**: Each day will be broken into minutes thus having 1440 minutes each simulation day where each player joins randomly within the random probability set.

## Metrics to Collect
Average latency per session
Percentage of unhappy players
Server overload rate
Average matchmaking time
Simulation runtime (seq vs parallel)

## Simulation Execution - Sequential and Multi-threading side-by-side

    - (avg_latency * 0.3) \
    - (disconnect_rate * 50) \
    - (unhappy_player_rate * 40) \
    - (overloaded_server_rate * 30)


## ‚úÖ Why Compare Sequential vs Multithreading/Multiprocessing?
Simulating thousands of randomized game server days ‚Äî that's a perfect fit for:
Monte Carlo (random scenarios)
Embarrassingly parallel workloads (each day is independent)


Comparing sequential vs. parallel execution gives:
Performance benchmarks (how much faster is parallelism?)
Insight into Python's threading/multiprocessing behavior
Relevance to real backend workloads

## Challenges in Finding Specific Published Research

While the application is logical and feasible, specific detailed research papers on using Monte Carlo for game server capacity planning with these precise goals might be less common in public academic databases compared to other applications of Monte Carlo simulation (like in finance or physics). This could be because:

- *Proprietary Information*: Game companies often consider their backend infrastructure and load testing methodologies to be competitive secrets. Detailed simulation models and results are unlikely to be published publicly.
- *Focus on Applied Engineering*: Much of the work in game backend development is focused on practical implementation and engineering challenges rather than theoretical research published in academic journals.
- *Variability Across Games*: Game backends are highly game-specific. A detailed simulation model for one game might not be directly applicable to another, making generalized research more challenging.
- *Alternative Simulation Techniques*: While Monte Carlo is suitable, other simulation techniques (e.g., discrete-event simulation, agent-based modeling) or purely data-driven approaches (using machine learning on live telemetry data) might also be used in the industry.

## Significance of the Study:
Helps developers anticipate server behavior under real-world chaotic player behavior.
Offers insights on how parallel computing can boost simulation-based testing.

- *(optional)* Provides back-end engineers with a flexible model to optimize matchmaking, queuing, and autoscaling algorithms.
